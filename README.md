In a time when government funding for sciences is dwindling, workshops that encourage youth to take an interest in science and technology are essential for the future of Canada and the world. 

Increased knowledge of technology helps to avoid fearful reactions to creative thinking and technological innovation, such as the case of Ahmed, a student recently arrested in Texas for bringing a homemade clock to school.

**Workshop** 
In light of recent events, in this workshop we will building a binary countup clock using a Arduino (https://www.arduino.cc/), and a string of WS2812 RGB LEDs, and two buttons. 
In this workshop we will be going over the following topics. 
 
- Install the Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE can be installed on Windows, MAC, or Linux.  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Windows
- Running the blink example project. This ensures that the arduino IDE and the arduino are working and talking to each other.  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink
- Adding a button, and adding a debouncing circut with a resistor resistors  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce
- Install 3rd party libraries into the arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries, https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-all-about-arduino-libraries-install-use
- Installing the adafruit Neo Pixel Arduino libary https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel
- Wiring the NeoPixel WS2812 RGB LEDs into the Arduino and power supply 
- Running the Neo Pixel Arduino strand test   https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/overview  
- Understanding how the Neopixel Arduino strand test works
 - Changing individual leds colors. 
 - Creating simple algorithms for generating patterns. https://instagram.com/p/7CVXrFA5TX/?taken-by=funvill
- Introduction to binary numbers https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-number-system.html
- Creating a count up clock. 
- Talking about what to do next. 
 
**Equipment**. 
- Arduino and programing cable if required. 
- 30 LED string of, WS2812 RGB LEDs 
- Mini breadboard 
- 2x A button 
- 2x resistors to debounce the button 
- A laptop. You must bring your own laptop for this workshop. We do not have any to spare. 
- 5V 1 Amp power supply
